# Gaussian Process Regression configuration
# Best for: small data, uncertainty quantification, interpretability

# Kernel configuration
kernel_type: rbf_ard  # rbf, rbf_ard (automatic relevance determination), matern
length_scale_bounds: [0.01, 100.0]  # Search range for length scales
nu: 1.5  # Only for Matern kernel (1.5 or 2.5 recommended)

# Noise and regularization
alpha: 1e-4  # Noise level (Ridge regularization on diagonal)
normalize_y: true  # Zero-mean normalize targets

# Optimizer
n_restarts_optimizer: 5  # Number of random restarts for hyperparameter optimization

# Output
output_std: true  # Return predictive standard deviation

# Scalability guards (exact GP is O(N^2) memory and O(N^3) time)
# Cap the number of training points and use batched prediction.
max_train_points: 4000       # Subsample to at most this many points for training
subsample_strategy: random   # random (default); future: kmeans
batch_predict_size: 2048     # Predict in batches to limit memory
